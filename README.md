# Online Offers Detector

Stores usually run discounts to attract new customers, increase sales, and clear out old inventory. Promotional and special offers is one of the most successful way of advertisement. Everyone wins something out of it. People can get stuff for their real price or less, and stores will get crowded and earns peopleâ€™s loyalty.

In this project we started with web scraping for restaurants and coffee shops social media accounts for special offers and discounts. Most of offers and discounts are in image format so it will be easier to automate the process of extracting images and feeding them to a deep learning model to extract the offers in the form of texts. The final product is a text containing the offer written in the image sent by a Telegram bot.

We utilized python files in https://github.com/kutvonenaki/simple_ocr after modifications to suit our need in this project.
